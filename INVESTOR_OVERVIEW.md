## The Market Opportunity

### Campus Commerce in Nigeria

Nigerian university campuses represent an untapped vertical market with unique characteristics:

- **High Transaction Volume**: Students constantly buy and sell textbooks, electronics, clothing, furniture, and services
- **Trust Deficit**: Current solutions (WhatsApp groups, unverified Facebook marketplaces) lack safety mechanisms
- **Price Sensitivity**: Students seek affordable alternatives to retail, driving peer-to-peer commerce
- **Proximity Value**: Campus-based transactions favor convenience and local delivery

### University of Ibadan Market

- **Institution Profile**: Premier Nigerian university with over 30,000 students
- **Annual Turnover**: Thousands of students graduate/enroll annually, creating constant demand for used goods
- **Residential Campus**: Hall-based residence system creates natural micro-markets
- **Digital-Native Users**: Young, tech-savvy student population comfortable with mobile commerce

---

## The Problem

Students at Nigerian universities face significant friction when buying or selling items:

1. **Safety Concerns**: No way to verify if sellers/buyers are legitimate students or external scammers
2. **Payment Risk**: No escrow protection; buyers risk losing money without receiving goods
3. **Discovery Challenges**: Finding specific items scattered across WhatsApp groups and social media is inefficient
4. **Price Opacity**: No centralized platform to compare prices or establish fair market value
5. **Communication Barriers**: Coordinating transactions across multiple platforms (WhatsApp, calls, social media)

**The Gap**: No existing platform combines student verification, escrow protection, and campus-specific discovery tools.

## Business Model

### Revenue Streams

**Primary: Transaction Fees** (Infrastructure Built, Not Yet Activated)
- Small percentage fee on completed escrow transactions
- Standard marketplace model (similar to Jumia, Konga, Amazon)
- Fees deducted automatically during payment release

**Planned Revenue Channels:**
- **Premium Seller Features**: Enhanced visibility, promoted listings, analytics
- **Referral Incentives**: Viral growth mechanism with ₦200 per successful referral (coded but not activated)
- **Campus Expansion**: Replicate model across Nigerian universities as separate marketplaces

### Unit Economics

**Advantages of Campus Model:**
- **Low CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)**: Word-of-mouth within closed campus community; viral coefficient high
- **High Retention**: Students remain on platform throughout 4-6 year university tenure
- **Natural Liquidity**: Supply and demand balanced by academic calendar (graduations, new intakes)
- **Network Effects**: Value increases exponentially as more students join

- Proactive notifications increase transaction conversion
- Data-driven tag ranking improves over time

### 4. **First-Mover Advantage**

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Key Risks
